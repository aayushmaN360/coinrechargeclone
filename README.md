# CloneRecharge - Virtual Coin Recharge UI

A simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript front-end project that mimics a virtual coin recharge interface. Users can input their username, select or enter custom coin amounts, and view calculated costs.

> ⚠️ This is a **frontend-only demo** — it does not process real payments or connect to any backend/API.

## 🚀 Features

- Select from preset coin packages or enter custom amounts
- Live price calculation
- Simple success confirmation modal
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly layout
- Self-contained: No external CSS/JS dependencies
